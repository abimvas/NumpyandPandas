Observation 1: While it may be easy to assume so, based on the data for the top five highest and lowest performing schools, there does not appear to be a correlation between the budget allocated per student. The average budget per student was higher among the lower performing schools then in the schools that performed better. Just because a school is more well-funded does not necessarily mean that the students will perform better.Observation 2: Class size and the number of students does affect the passing rate and how students perform. Comparing the highest and lowest performing schools, the lower performing schools consistently had a larger number of students, while the schools that performed well had a smaller student population.Observation 3: Overall Charter schools performed better than District schools. This may be due to Charter schools, on average, having a smaller student population that District schools, which would positively impact performance. Charter schools had a higher passing percentage in both reading and math, leading to a high overall passing percentage.
